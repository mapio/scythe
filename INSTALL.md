# Installation instructions

Create an empty dir that we'll be the **base dir**, download and unpack the
[latest release](https://github.com/scythe-suite/scythe/releases/latest) of the
`scythe.tgz`, `exercises.tgz`, `confs.tgz` archives; you can accomplish such
task manually, or just executing the following command in the shell

    curl -sL https://git.io/install-scythe | bash

Every time you'll need to use this tool, just go to the *base dir* and set the
required environment variables using

    source ./setenv.sh

Note that if you use [direnv](https://direnv.net/) just link `setenv.sh` to
`.envrc` and direnv will take care of this step for you!

Now setup your local configurations: go in the newly created `confs` dir,
move `confs.sh-template` to `confs.sh` and move `confs.py-template` to `confs.py`,
then edit the first lines of the first file

    export SCYTHE_USER="<REMOTE_USER_HERE>"
    export SCYTHE_SERVER="<REMOTE_HOST_HERE>"

to reflect your username, and the credentials for the deploy site; the
`confs.py` file contains a some default used in the creation of
[tristo-mietitore](https://github.com/scythe-suite/tristo-mietitore)
configuration.


Observe that you will probably need also to edit the files under
`confs/basebundle` dir to reflect your local exam setup (i.e., the `README`
files, and the support commands under the `bin` subdirectoryâ€¦).

You are ready to install the various dependencies (this must be done the first
time you use the tool, or when an update of any of the dependencies is issued):
simply run

    scythe upgrade

this will download and install for you the latest releases of
[scythe](https://github.com/scythe-suite/scythe),
[tristo-mietitore](https://github.com/scythe-suite/tristo-mietitore),
[sim-fun-i](https://github.com/scythe-suite/sim-fun-i),
[scythe-tester](https://github.com/scythe-suite/scythe-tester),
[md2html](https://github.com/scythe-suite/md2html).

## A simple test

The unzipped example configuration and exercises should allow a simple test: run

    source ./setenv.sh
    scythe prepare example

this should generate `./confs/example-st.py` and `./confs/example-tm.py`, the
configuration files; to run the other steps you'll need to have a
`scythe-server` administrator to enable your account.

## Save your work!

If you want to edit and keep track of your configuration and exercises you are
suggested to turn `confs` and `exercises` into git repositories (after removing
the example exam configuration and exercises).
